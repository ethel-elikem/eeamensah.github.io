excerpt: """This thesis models a time-dependent bi-criteria bus routing problem (TDBBRP) to find optimal paths for a bus from an origin to a destination in a road network. We set the problem up as a multi-objective integer or binary programming problem and solve it using a weighted sum method. We use the flow speed model to explore the incorporation of time-dependence and varying traffic congestion along arcs in the model. The result is a conflict in minimizing the criteria of distance and time simultaneously and path flexibility for certain start times at the origin. We implemented the TDBBR model on a hypothetical road network. The results are verified using the mathematical definitions of efficient solutions and non-dominated points and are satisfactory."""
