excerpt: """Location-based online services, such as Google Maps, provide a valuable lens for examining social dynamics in both online (virtual) and offline (physical) spaces. In particular, online reviews offer insights into how cultural or ethnic differences shape mobility patterns, place preferences, and public expression. This study analyzes the spatial behaviour of select ethnic groups in a German border city by integrating Google Maps reviews with demographic data. Using comparative analysis, we identify patterns in place engagement and disparities in urban space usage across different population groups. The findings highlight how socio-demographic factors influence the frequency and types of places visited, revealing gaps in urban accessibility. These insights demonstrate the potential of Google Maps data for understanding socio-spatial dynamics and inform strategies for more inclusive and data-driven urban planning."""
